# Toxic-Tweets-Classification-using-LSTM

A project made to analyze a CSV dataset obtained from Kaggle containing tweets classified on various parameters such as toxicity and obscenity.
Steps taken to solve the problem:
1. Cleaning data by removing non-ascii characters, special characters, etc. 
2. Employing Lemmatization and removing stop words and ommisions
3. This was followed by training 3 different types of LSTMs and checking their accuracy with the provided test data

The Three LSTMs used were:
 - LSTM
 - Bidirectional LSTM
 - Gated Recurrent Units LSTM
 
 This project was made for me to learn more about RNNs and common Deep Learning practises
 It was an attempt to learn about Natural Language Processing and usimng certain libraries such as NLTK, TensorFlow and re
